# Dolt

[Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt) is a hybrid of a relational database and a version control system (specifically: MySQL and Git). One can run SQL queries, but also do version control and work on branches (both the database structure and the data are versioned).

This is used to share databases at [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). They have data bounties: money is paid for creating a PR that fills the database with some desired data (e.g. data bounty for getting up-to-date contact data for all US hospitals).

Written in Go.
